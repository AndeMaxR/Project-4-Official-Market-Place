The descriptions of the products should not exceed 200 characters.
We did not implement a JUnit test class, because from our understanding, a main method utilizing all classes and methods was sufficient. All testing is and should be done with the main method that is implemented inside of the Market class. 
For testing, you must use/create a seller first and add an item in order to create or login as a buyer and buy a product. 
(Think of it this way: how can a buyer buy a product that doesn't exist).
But, we handled the case where this occurs, so try creating and logging in as a buyer, to test the edge case where no products exist. 
The program runs infinitely until you enter 3 to cancel, so you can test all cases without having to re-run the program multiple times. 

Mark submitted the report, presentation, and the project.
