The descriptions of the products should not exceed 200 characters
For testing, you must use/create a seller first and add an item in order to create or login as a buyer and buy a product. 
(Think of it this way: how can a buyer buy a product that doesn't exist).
But, we handled the case where this occurs, so try creating and logging in as a buyer, to test the edge case where no products exist. 
The program runs infinitely until you enter 3 to cancel, so you can test all cases without having to re-run the program multiple times.
